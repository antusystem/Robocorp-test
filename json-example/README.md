# Robocorp Test
## Robot using json

This robots shows you how to use  the `RPA.JSON` library to manipulate JSON files. It shows how to read, save, edit, add data, change data, delete data from a JSON file.

## Note: it only works with RCC, tested in rpaframework=9.5.0 and python 3.7.5

### Configuration

 You need a file named `example.json` with data to run the example. I use this data:
 
{
  "Ordenes": {
   "clave": "123456789",
   "accion": "borrartodo" 
  }
}
