# Robocorp Test
## Robot for writing and reading the console

	This code show how to use several libraries to connect to a gmail account, search for a message read its content and also read the content from and attachment it carries (in both cases a json) and interact with the information from the body/attachment from an email.
	
	Note: it uses personal libraries to interact with the strings, but it might be better to use the `String` library from Robocorp.
	
	Note 2: the part manipulating the JSON only runs in RCC, if you execute "normaly" in Robocorp Lab it will show an error.

### Configuration

You have to change in `devdata/env.json` the correct location of the json with the credentials
